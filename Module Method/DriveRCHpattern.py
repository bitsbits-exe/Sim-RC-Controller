"""
Simulator RC Controller
==USB-TTL Module Version with H-Pattern Transmission==

This script interfaces with racing simulation games through CRSF (Crossfire) protocol,
providing realistic H-pattern manual transmission control with anti-lock braking system (ABS)
and burnout functionality.

Features:
- H-pattern gear shifting with clutch control
- Progressive throttle scaling per gear
- ABS braking with pulsing effect
- Burnout mode for first gear
- Handbrake functionality
- Smooth throttle decay during gear shifts

Dependencies:
- pygame (for joystick input)
- pyserial (for CRSF communication)
- crsf_parser (for CRSF frame building)
