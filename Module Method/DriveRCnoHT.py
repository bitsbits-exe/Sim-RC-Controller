"""
Simulator RC Controller
===USB-TTL Module Version NO HEADTRACKING===

This script interfaces with a joystick/controller and transmits control data
using the CRSF (Crossfire) protocol over serial communication. It includes
features like ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) simulation and smooth
brake deceleration for realistic vehicle control.

Features:
- Joystick input mapping to CRSF channels
- ABS simulation with configurable frequency and duty cycle
- Smooth braking deceleration
- Handbrake override functionality
- Camera pan/tilt control
- Real-time serial communication via FTDI adapter

Dependencies:
- pygame (for joystick input)
- pyserial (for CRSF communication)
- crsf_parser (for CRSF frame building)
